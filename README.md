# Network Intrusion Detection using Machine Learning

This project aims to develop a network intrusion detection system using machine learning algorithms and feature engineering techniques.

## Features

- Classification of network traffic into normal or anomalous behavior


## Dataset

The project uses the [Network Intrusion Detection dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sampadab17/network-intrusion-detection) for training and testing the models. The dataset provides information about network traffic features, including duration, protocol type, service, source and destination bytes, and more.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn

## Installation Instructions

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/network-intrusion-detection.git
